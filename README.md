2 . Install the required packages:

## Download dataset

This project was done in google colab so i dont download dataset but i use kaggle API to download dataset into colab and use it.
This all code is in notebook please refer that code.

1. download kaggle.json from kaggle
2. upload this kaggle.json file into colab
3. copy the command form kaggle and paste it into the cell of notebook and run this cell
4. finally download all dataset into colab file system.
